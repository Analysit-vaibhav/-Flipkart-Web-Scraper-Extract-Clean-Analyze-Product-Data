## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🏗 **requests** – For sending HTTP requests
- 🔍 **BeautifulSoup** – For parsing and extracting HTML content
- 📊 **pandas** – For data manipulation & exporting
- 🔢 **numpy** – For handling missing values & numeric conversions
- ⏳ **time** – For implementing request delays to avoid blocking

---

## ⚠ Important Notes
🚨 **Respect `robots.txt`**: Always check if the website allows web scraping before proceeding.
🚨 **Use Headers and Proxies**: Some websites block bots—using headers and proxies can help bypass restrictions.
🚨 **Implement Delays**: Adding `time.sleep()` between requests prevents server overload and reduces the risk of getting blocked.

---

## 🔄 Customization
🛠 Modify the `target_url` variable in `web_scraper.py` to scrape different websites.
🛠 Adjust `BeautifulSoup` parsing logic to match the target website’s structure.
🛠 Set a custom refresh interval for automated scraping.
